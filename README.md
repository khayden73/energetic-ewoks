# Energetic Ewoks

## Description

An experiment and learning tool. I wanted to start a project from scratch using Vite and have always enjoyed building UI components. The idea was to build a small, flexible component library that I can use in personal projects. It's very basic and rudimentary at this point, but will grow.

## tech stack

React + TypeScript + Vite

I love learning new things, and getting to know vite has been fun.

Yes, I actually code for fun.

## the project

I don't know yet if this is something I would open source as something for people to actually use. Perhaps it would help someone else on their learning path. I don't recommend using it in a production site, but if you're a tinkerer, like me, and you just want to fork it and figure some stuff out, have at it.

## CSS

I'm a big CSS nerd, so I want to build out the styles myself, instead of using something off the shelf like Tailwind. 

## TODO

See the TODO list readme

## Vite

see the VITE_README file, which was the default README when first creating the project
